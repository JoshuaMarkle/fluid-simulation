# Fluid Simulation

Just me playing around with some fluid physics. 

Nothing is really optimized too aggressively yet and I'm not sure about the future of this project yet.

## Running the simulation

You will need to have OpenGL installed along with `make`, `glfw`, & `glm`. This repo contains [Dear ImGui](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui) (UI system) as a submodule.

Downloading the repo (without history):

```
git clone --depth=1 --recurse-submodules --shallow-submodules https://github.com/JoshuaMarkle/fluid-simulation.git
```

Compile with `make`!

## Licensing

This project is free use and can be used anywhere.
